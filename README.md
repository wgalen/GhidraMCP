# Features
MCP Server + Ghidra Plugin

- Decompile and analyze binaries in Ghidra
- Automatically rename methods and data

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Mac / Windows
- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)
- Python3

## Ghidra
First, download the latest [release](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/releases) from this repository. This contains the Ghidra plugin and Python MCP client. Then, you can directly import the plugin into Ghidra.

1. Run Ghidra
2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`
3. Click the `+` button
4. Select the `GhidraMCP-1-0.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release
5. Restart Ghidra
6. Make sure the GhidraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`

## MCP Clients

Theoretically, any MCP client should work with ghidraMCP.  Two examples are given below.

## Example 1: Claude Desktop
To set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghidra": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, edit this file directly:
```
/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

## Example 2: 5ire
Another MCP client that supports multiple models on the backend is [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire). To set up GhidraMCP, open 5ire and go to `Tools` -> `New` and set the following configurations:

1. Tool Key: ghidra
2. Name: GhidraMCP
3. Command: `python /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py`

# Building from Source
Build with Maven by running:

`mvn clean package assembly:single`

The generated zip file includes the built Ghidra plugin and its resources. These files are required for Ghidra to recognize the new extension.

- lib/GhidraMCP.jar
- extensions.properties
- Module.manifest
